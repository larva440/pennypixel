# Penny Pixel Secret Quest

How i get my first Junior Unity Developer Badge
story based on true experience

It is my first game created in Unity, as you can see it is based on tutorial, but it is still mine!
I do not know why i sharing it but i decided to do so.

It took me 1 week to learn basics of Unity by watching random YouTube videos about game development, 
then i decided i'm ready to make my own 2d platform game from scratch.

*4 hours later*

...ok, maybe better to start with template - Penny Pixel looks promising.
As far i know all assests are free and look very nice - i take it.

Meanwhile i defined my MVP as:

* Starting screen
* One level that is possible to finish.
* Player must be able to die or win
* Score should be visible.
* Ending screen with congrats.

and the main GOAL:

**Deploy working game to google play store.**

From this moment it took me around 20 hours to code and publish my MVP to google play store.

My mistakes:
* Imported Game Development Framework (free from unity store) hoping it will provide starting screen, scoring etc. for free - but i did not manage to use it
* Imported some other useless free stuff, that make even more mess in the project.
* Tried two free Joystick emulators for touch screens - they are too complicated for begginers, it just brought more mess to the project.
Eventually i decided to code my own steering mechanism for touch screen.
* I experimented with new Unity tree generators and of course
* ...

## Here are my tips, in case you would like to try to learn Unity this way.

- Define MVP and GOAL.
- Start with a template
- Extend with your code, use youtube to learn things on demand.
- Try refrain from experimenting with all this fantastic stuff you just saw on youtube like AI agents, tree generators, amazing 3d particle systems and all this cool features and assets - it will destroy your project eventually
- It is ok to add git later.
- If you stuck you can always use static (sic!)
- Stay focused on your goal - your goal is to deplay MVP to play store as soon as possible.
- Deploy
- clean up later - feel satisfaction deeply - try to analyze this feeling as it happen.
- retrospectively describe your experience and publish on github.

## As a retired senior dev i was ashamed to show this lame code, so i decided it is a good reason to make it public - i wrote this story to justify myself.

Definitely it was one of my most exciting coding trip.
